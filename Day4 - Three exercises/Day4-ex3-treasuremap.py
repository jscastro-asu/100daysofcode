'''Instructions
You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map.'''

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","⬜","⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")

position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇

hor = int(position[0])
ver = int(position[1])

#list of index is out of range so you want to minus 1 since there is no third index
row_select = map[ ver-1 ]
row_select[hor-1] = "X"

#other way map[ver - 1][hor - 1] = "X"



#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
